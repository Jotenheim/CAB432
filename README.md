# CityVibes
Twitter semantic analysis with spotify integration

# Concept
Type in a city and a spotify playlist is created. The application that parses incoming tweets using semantic analysis and generates a value between 0 and 1. This value is passed to Spotify's recommendation service which generates a song with a similar "Vibe" or "Emotional Weight".

The result is a playlist that reflects the mood of the city over time. This was created using Node.JS and uses Twitter, Spotify and Here-Geocoding API's.
